# Statistical-Model-Predicting-Restaurants-Visit-with-respect-to-seasonality.
I picked this dataset from a Kaggle competition in which data considers daily visitors to four restaurants located in the United States, subject to American holidays. For the exogenous variable holiday, I used SARIMAX machine learning model to see how holidays affect restaurant visits. The dataset contains 478 days of restaurant data, plus an additional 39 days of holiday data for forecasting purposes. I accomplished this prediction and forecasting backing up by statistical analysis, plotting variables and handling missing values.
